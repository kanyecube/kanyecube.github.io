        <p>
        I am not the real Kanye West nor do I have any connection to him. This site
        is for the sole purpose of hosting the stuff I do, which isn't much yet.
        You can see what I've done so far below.

        You can go to my YouTube channel
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqKEpSqev6gx4BcU2_3cZzg">here</a>.
        This empty channel is my only link at the moment. If you couldn't tell
        already this site is pretty bare bones as of now. I'll write something and
        post more edits eventually.
